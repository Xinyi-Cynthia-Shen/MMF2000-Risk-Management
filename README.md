# MMF2000 Risk Management

## ðŸ“Š Overview

This repository contains a series of comprehensive assignments completed for the **MMF2000 Risk Management** course in the **Master of Mathematical Finance (MMF)** program at the University of Toronto. The assignments cover critical areas of risk management, including regulatory capital, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and anti-money laundering (AML) risk.

Each report applies theoretical concepts and quantitative methods to real-world financial problems, reflecting best practices in financial risk management.
